Yet another javascript assignments. There are a lot of interactive javascript resources for beginners, but most of them are online and do not cover the modern programming workflow. There are some excellent training resources on github (https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment, https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans, https://github.com/vasanthk/js-bits etc) but they are not exactly simulate the everyday programming process. So the motivation of this project is to show TDD process in the wild to the beginners. Assingment tests are implemented in various ways to feel a difference and gain the experience what manner is good, what is bad and what is ugly.
